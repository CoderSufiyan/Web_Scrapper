Given link of IPL 2020-2021 home page.
https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/ipl-2020-21-1210595.
I scrapped the data using this link in the format displayed below.

1. Created a folder of IPL 2020.
2. Inside that folder created folders for each team playing in that IPL tournament.
3. Created an Excel file of each batsman in that team folder in which I stored details of the player in the form of array of object where each object describes a particular match played by a player. 
Details of an object includes
	a. Runs, balls, sixes , fours, strike rate (sr) for that match
	b. date ,venue ,result and opponent name for that match
